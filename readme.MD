Design Patterns
===============

Why?
- Design Patterns provide easy to recognize and use OOP solutions to common problems. 
- When you see a common recurring problem, you find a common, general solution to solve it.

-------------

1) Creational

These design patterns are all about class instantiation or object creation. These patterns can be further categorized into Class-creational patterns and object-creational patterns <br />
Factory Method <br />
Abstract Factory <br />
Builde <br />
Singleton <br />
Object Pool <br />
Prototype <br />

-------------

2) Structural

These design patterns are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality.  <br />
Adapter  <br />
Bridge  <br />
Decorator  <br />
Facade  <br />
Proxy  <br />
Composite  <br />
Flyweight  <br />
Private Class Data <br />

-------------

3) Behavioral

Behavioral patterns are about identifying common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns.<br />
Observer <br />
Strategy <br />
Chain of responsibility <br />
Command <br />
Interpreter <br />
Iterator <br />
Mediator <br />
Memento <br />
Null Object <br />
