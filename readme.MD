Design Principles 
================

In the object-oriented design, we …
1) Identify Objects
2) Refine Objects - Remove duplicates, combine/split objects, identify attributes and behaviours of objects
3) Draw objects
4) Identify object relationships
 
KISS - Keep It Simple, Stupid
DRY - Don’t Repeat Yourself
YAGNI - You Ain’t Gonna Need It

Design Patterns
===============

Why?
- Design Patterns provide easy to recognize and use OOP solutions to common problems. 
- When you see a common recurring problem, you find a common, general solution to solve it.

1) Creational
-------------
These design patterns are all about class instantiation or object creation. These patterns can be further categorized into Class-creational patterns and object-creational patterns
	Factory Method *
	Abstract Factory *
	Builder *
	Singleton *
	Object Pool
	Prototype

2) Structural
-------------
These design patterns are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality.
	Adapter *
	Bridge *
	Decorator *
	Facade *
	Proxy *
	Composite
	Flyweight
	Private Class Data

3) Behavioral
-------------
Behavioral patterns are about identifying common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns.
	Observer *
	Strategy *
	Chain of responsibility *
	Command
	Interpreter
	Iterator
	Mediator
	Memento
	Null Object
	State
	Template method
	Visitor
